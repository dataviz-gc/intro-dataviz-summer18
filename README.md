# Introduction to Data Visualization
- CUNY Graduate Center | Summer 2018
- TODO Course Number
- Monday - Thursday 6:00 to 8:00 | 5/29 - 6/21 | TODO Location
- Office Hours: By Appointment
- Taught by: Erin Daugherty and Michelle McSweeney

## Description
As employers in every sector continue to search for candidates that can turn their data into actionable information, this course is designed to demystify data analysis by approaching it visually. Using Tableau Software, we will build a series of interactive visualizations that combine data and logic with storytelling and design. We will dive into cleaning and structuring unruly data sets, identifying which chart types work best for different types of data, and unpacking the tactics behind effective visual communication. With an eye towards critical evaluation of both data and method, projects and discussion will be geared towards humanities and social science research. Regardless of your academic concentration, you will walk away from this class with a portfolio of dynamic dashboards and a new interdisciplinary skill set ready to leverage in your academic and professional work.

## Our Objectives
By the end of this class, you will be able to:

- Build interactive data visualization dashboards that answer a clear and purposeful research question
- Choose which chart type works best for different types of data
- Iterate with fluidity in Tableau Software leveraging visualization, aesthetic, and user interface best practices
- Structure thoughtful critiques and communicate technical questions and solutions 
- Leverage collaborative tools, including Tableau Public, Github, and repositories of public data sets
- Contribute to the broader conversation about digital practices in academic research
- Critically read a wide range of chart types with an eye for accuracy, audience, and effectiveness
- Identify potential weaknesses in the collection methods and structure of underlying data sets 
- Locate the original source of a visualization and its data




## Assignments
During this course, you will complete four assignments: 2 guided projects and a final portfolio accompanied by a white paper. We expect that you will turn in each project before you feel fully ready to do so. You will have the opportunity to submit revisions of the first two blog projects until you're satisfied with the outcome.

## Our Schedule
Because this is a Summer Session course, we will cover a lot of ground in just four weeks. Attendance is essential for understanding the material and doing well in the course. Each class period will be divided into two parts: a seminar and a hands-on practicum. The seminar will focus on a theoretical component underpinning data visualization, and the second half will be a hands-on tutorial in Tableau. By the end of this course, you will have both a deep understanding of why we do things and how to ethically engage in visual communication.

## A Few Final Thoughts
- one paragraph letter to the students
- we are here to help you, ask questions, speak up when you're confused
- be generous with your knowledge; these contributions are more valuable than hording information
- if there's something you wanted to learn and you're not seeing it here, let us know
- if you do not have easy access to a laptop during class, let us know
- what information does CUNY provide regarding disability or academic resources?
- we are striving for progress, not perfection. -Erin & Michelle
